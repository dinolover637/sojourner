#### Preliminary Design
Create iso and "exploded view" models for parts listed:
* Portable Router
* Paneling (Probably foam board)
* Motors
* Turning mechanism
* Sensors
* Wheels
* ~~Custom attachment pieces (To attach the foam board. These will be 3D printed)~~ Not anymore we're not
#### Parts List
These parts will be listed in the file parts.md

#### Basic chassis for wheel testing
This needs to be done before we start the code. We need to know the position of
all the parts and before programming is done of maximum efficiency.

#### Wheel Control Test program
The wheels and motors will be controlled through ~~an Arduino~~ Raspberry Pi
(Unstable but it works).
#### Constructing the rest of the frame
~~The body of the car is most likely to be made using lego pieces and the foam
board body will attach to the frame with custom pieces~~
Literally just lego and foam board loosely attached to each other.

#### Extra Features
* Solar Panel that isn't connected to anything and provides nothing but
